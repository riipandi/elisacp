Manage linux server without hassle. ElisaCP is an open source Linux Control Panel. It's 
written in Golang and React and runs as a single Linux binary with MySQL or PostgreSQL. 
Use the features you like, for example, create virtualhost, manage MariaDB PostgreSQL 
database, etc, with full access to source code.

> Currently only work on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS and Ubuntu 20.04 LTS only.

__Important Note:__
